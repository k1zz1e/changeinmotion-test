Getting started here! How simple a process it was to transition over from bluehost to Cloudflare.  Of course there was a few small steps I had to learn but overall fairly simple.  

The bluehost interface allowed me to manage the entire process from their website.  I used CPanel to download my whole Wordpress site backup file. I was a bit surprised since the ICANN site showed my registar was a company called NETWORK SOLUTIONS, LLC. Thought I may have to pay to transfer from them as well.
